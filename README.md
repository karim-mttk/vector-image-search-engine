# vector-image-search-engine
This repository demonstrates the utilization of Weaviate, a vector search engine, for searching image data. 

Weaviate employs a vectorization technique to represent data, such as images, as vectors. Each image is allocated a vector within a high-dimensional space. A neural network is responsible for generating these vectors during the vectorization process. Once the images are represented as vectors, Weaviate facilitates the search for similar images through vector operations. Feel free to share and use the code ;)
